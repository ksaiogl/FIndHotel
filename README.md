## Geolocation Service

### Overview
You're provided with a CSV file (`data_dump.csv`) that contains raw geolocation data; the goal is to develop a service written in Ruby that imports such data and expose it via an API.

```

```

### Requirements
1. Develop a library with two main features:
    * a service that parses the CSV file containing the raw data and persists it in a database;
    * an interface to provide access to the geolocation data (model layer);
1. Develop a REST API that uses the aforementioned gem to expose the geolocation data

In doing so:
* define a data format suitable for the data contained in the CSV file;
* sanitize the entries (the file comes from an unreliable source; this means that the entries can be duplicated, may miss some value, the value can not be in the correct format or completely bogus);
* at the end of the import process, return some statistics about the time elapsed, as well as the number of entries accepted/discarded;
* the library should be configurable by an external configuration (particularly with regards to the DB configuration);
* the API layer should implement a single endpoint that, given an IP address, returns information about the IP address' location (i.e. country, city);
* the endpoint should be developed according to the HTTP/1.1 standard;
* the endpoint should be made accessible via a web application framework of your choice (e.g. Sinatra, Rails, etc);
* write the adequate test coverage using a unit test framework of your choice (e.g. RSpec, MiniTest);

### Expected outcome and shipping:
* a Ruby gem that packages the import service and the interface for accessing the geolocation data;
* the REST API application (that uses the aforementioned gem) should be Dockerised and the Dockerfile should be included in the solution;
* deploy the project on a cloud platform of your choice (e.g. AWS, Heroku, etc):
    * run a container for the API layer;
    * run any other container that you think necessary;
    * have a database prepared with the already imported data

### Notes
* the file's contents are fake, you don't have to worry about data correctness
* in production the import service would run as part of a scheduled/cron job, but we don't want that part implemented as part of this exercise
* for local/development run a DB container can be included
* you can structure the repository as you see it fit
